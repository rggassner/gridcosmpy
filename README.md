# gridcosmpy

A python script to generate flythrough videos zooming in and out from the gridcosm project.

It scraps all images from the site, creates intermediary images, upscales the image quality and uses ffmpeg to generate videos.

Warning, the process takes several days.

#Dependencies

apt install libvulkan-dev swig

pip install waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan-python python-ffmpeg
